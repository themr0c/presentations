I am a senior technical writer and cloud infrastructure architect with an advanced experience of Linux, Ansible, Antora, and collaboration in Open Source Software.

I mainly write in AsciiDoc, Bash and YAML.
I enjoy other languages too.

I can understand or design complex workloads and trace issues.
I am a keen independent learner.

I can lead a team and challenge people to get the best of themselves.

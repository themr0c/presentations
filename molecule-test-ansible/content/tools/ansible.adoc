### Ansible

[quote, https://docs.ansible.com/ansible]
Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software,
and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero
downtime rolling updates.
Ansible’s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use.

It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring a minimum
of moving parts, usage of OpenSSH for transport (with other transports and
pull modes as alternatives), and a language that is designed around
auditability by humans–even those not familiar with the program.

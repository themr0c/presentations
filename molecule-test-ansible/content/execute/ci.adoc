### Automation on a continuous integration server

* On pull request. Never merge broken code!
* At commit on release branches / tags.
* Foresee long compute time !
* Need to run privileged Docker containers

### Use molecule docker image

----
docker_image_name="quay.io/ansible/molecule:2.19" // <1>
gid_map="$(grep docker /etc/group |cut -d: -f3,3)" // <2>
local_playbooks_absolute_path="$(readlink -f "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")" // <3>
docker run \
  -e "WORKDIR=${molecule_workdir}" \ // <3>
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ // <4>
  -v "${local_playbooks_absolute_path}:${molecule_workdir}" // <3>
  "${docker_image_name}" bash "molecule test"
----

<1> Docker image from https://quay.io/repository/ansible/molecule
<2> Map local user
<3> Mount the code
<4> Share docker socket

We run molecule from a docker container, and from this docker container
we need to create other container: we need access to the docker socket!

Current implementation of docker support in Bamboo doesn't allow this
(unsafe) behaviour.

We had to bake our own docker orchestration sequence (handled by
ansible/tests/tests_suite.sh)

    Pull/Run the docker image containing molecule and friends,
    Mount the playbooks and roles repository,
    Run the desired test suite (handled by ansible/tests/detox_wrapper.sh)

### Orchestration pitfalls

TIP: 1 repository == 1 role

CAUTION: multiple roles => external orchestration

* scenarios => sequential

* platforms => parallel

[.notes]
--
We have one unique Git repository containing the complete collection of
all roles. It means that when CI runs the tests, all roles should be
tested. We would avoid a lot of complication if each role would have its
own repository. It is a bad architectural choice, but a  business
decision and we have to live with it.

Tox is able to run the tests in parallel, instead of sequentially. But
blind parallelization on one unique agent is a bad idea our usecase.

To test the elasticsearch and redis roles for instance, we create
complex topologies which use a lot of memory. As a consequence we need
to fine tune the orchestration to avoid out of memory errors when
running to many memory hungry tests in parallel.

Given on CI platform (bamboo), the best approach we found was to group
roles in multiple test suites, each suite being run on a different agent
(handled by ansible/tests/detox_wrapper.sh).

*    all elasticsearch related roles, to test sequentially
*    all redis related roles, to test sequentially
*    all other linux related roles, candidates to maximize parallelism
*    all azure/windows bound roles, also candidates to maximize
parallelism (and subject to high error rate)
